# AMD Ryzen AI

<Tip>

Ryzen AI support is work in progress and will greatly be improved and extended in the coming months.

</Tip>

AMD's Ryzen™ AI family of laptop processors provide users with an integrated Neural Processing Unit (NPU) which offloads the host CPU and GPU from AI processing tasks. Ryzen™ AI software consists of the Vitis™ AI execution provider (EP) for ONNX Runtime combined with quantization tools and a pre-optimized model zoo. All of this is made possible based on Ryzen™ AI technology built on AMD XDNA™ architecture, purpose-built to run AI workloads efficiently and locally, offering a host of benefits for the developer innovating the next groundbreaking AI app.

Optimum-AMD provides easy interface for loading and inference of Hugging Face models on Ryzen AI accelerator.

## Ryzen AI Environment setup

A Ryzen AI environment needs to be enabled to use this library. Please refer to Ryzen AI's [Installation](https://ryzenai.docs.amd.com/en/latest/inst.html) and [Runtime Setup](https://ryzenai.docs.amd.com/en/latest/runtime_setup.html).

## Minimal working example

To load a model and run inference with RyzenAI, you can just replace your `AutoModelForXxx` class with the corresponding `RyzenAIModelForXxx` class.

```python
import requests
from PIL import Image

from optimum.amd.ryzenai import RyzenAIModelForImageClassification
from transformers import AutoFeatureExtractor, pipeline

url = "http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg"
image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

model_id = <path of the model>
model = RyzenAIModelForImageClassification.from_pretrained(model_id, vaip_config=<path to config file>)
feature_extractor = AutoFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained(model_id)
cls_pipe = pipeline("image-classification", model=model, feature_extractor=feature_extractor)
outputs = cls_pipe(image)
```
